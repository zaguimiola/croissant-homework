    <p>
      Croissants are a style of viennoiserie pastries, which of course relates
      back to the Austrian city of Vienna, otherwise known as the birthplace of
      croissants. The ancestor to the modern-day croissant was called the
      kipferl, which dates back to the 13th century and comes in various shapes
      and sizes. They are often filled with nuts or other fillings, and kipferl
      (which have possible but unconfirmed roots in ancient Egypt), are also
      considered to be a form of rugelach, a Jewish pastry of Ashkenazic origin.
      They are denser and sweeter to what we think of as the modern croissant.
      Around the turn of the 17th century, that dough began to change, and the
      style of dough used in traditional croissants was first documented. How it
      morphed into the traditional croissant, though, is still a part of
      culinary lore. Legend has it, Viennese bakers working throughout the night
      heard the Turks as they tried to tunnel beneath the city during a 1683
      invasion. They alerted the city‚Äôs defenders, in essence saving it from the
      Ottoman siege. In celebration, the bakers created a pastry that would
      symbolize the crescent moon, which is also the prominent symbol on the
      Turkish flag. The German word kipferl, or crescent, became a culinary
      re-enactment of Vienna‚Äôs victory over the Turks. The first verified
      evidence of the croissant in France is due to a baker named August Zang.
      Zang had an upscale patisserie in Paris in the early 1800s, named the
      Boulangerie Viennoise after his native Vienna and serving many of their
      famous treats ‚Äî including kipferl. His Parisian version, though, was made
      flakier than the traditional sweets, and Parisians began calling them
      croissants because of their crescent shapes. Finally, in 1915, a French
      baker named Sylvain Claudius Goy would write the recipe that we all know
      and love today.
